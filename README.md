# push_swap
A program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest amount of instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.

## Bonus
A program named checker that takes as an argument the stack a formatted as a list of integers.

It will then wait and read instructions on the standard input, each instruction will be followed by ’\n’. Once all the instructions have been read, the program has to execute them on the stack received as an argument.

If after executing those instructions, the stack a is actually sorted and the stack b is empty, then the program must display "OK" followed by a ’\n’ on the standard output.
